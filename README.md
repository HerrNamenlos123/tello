# Tello

C++14 single-header cross-platform library to control a DJI Ryze Tello drone using the Tello SDK 2.0

## Build process

There is no build or install process for the library. You only need to include [tello.hpp](tello.hpp) and that's it. Look at the examples to see how to use it.

Alternatively, there is also a `CMakeLists.txt` available, so if you want to keep it easy to update you might also use this repository as a git submodule. Then you would simply include the library in cmake. Take a look at the [example](example) folder to see how it is done using CMake.

## Portability/Compatitibility

This library is written in C++14, which means your program including it must be compiled using at least C++14 or higher. It was written in a way that it is compatible with compilers going back to gcc-4.9, which was the gcc version for Debian Jessie.

This library is cross-platform, it works exactly the same on Windows and Linux. MacOS is untested. It was tested on Windows 10 and on Debian Jessie for backwards compatibility.

`tello.hpp` includes the Linux API or the Win32 API correspondingly. If this causes a conflict with another library or simply pollutes your headers too much, you must separate them by moving it into a different cpp file. In the best case, only use the Tello library in a single cpp file and do all other stuff in other files, not touching the Tello calls anymore. This gives you the cleanest project and the fastest build times.

## Examples

### Building the example

```bash
cd example
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .    # Build the app, regardless of the build system (e.g. calls 'make')
```

### Simple example

```c++
Tello tello;
if (!tello.connect()) {     // This can take a different Tello IP address if needed
    return;
}

tello.takeoff();

// Do something, fly around

tello.land();
```

### Most important functions

These are your basic functions for controlling the Tello drone
```c++
tello.connect();
tello.takeoff();
tello.land();
```

Basic incremental movement functions
```c++
tello.set_speed(cm/s)
tello.move_up(cm);
tello.move_down(cm);
tello.move_left(cm);
tello.move_right(cm);
tello.move_forward(cm);
tello.move_back(cm);
tello.turn_right(degrees);
tello.turn_left(degrees);
tello.move_by(x, y, z, speed);
```

Main function for more sophisticated controllers: This function basically simulates an RC controller, so it can be called in a loop to continuously set the speed in all directions
```c++
tello.move(left/right, forward/backward, up/down, yaw);
```

Sensor readings
```c++
tello.get_speed();
tello.get_battery_level();
tello.get_flight_time();
tello.get_wifi_snr();
tello.get_sdk_version();
tello.get_serial_number();
```

Disclaimer: Only the functions which you are most likely to use are listed here. Not all are documented.

### Mission Pad API

All functions regarding Mission Pads are separated into a nested structure, because they are very uncommon to use for most users. This keeps your IntelliSense suggestions clean.

```c++
tello.missionPadAPI.enable_pad_detection();
tello.missionPadAPI.disable_pad_detection();
tello.missionPadAPI.set_pad_detection_direction();
tello.missionPadAPI.fly_straight_to_pad();
tello.missionPadAPI.fly_arc_to_pad();
tello.missionPadAPI.jump_to_next_pad();
```

## My drone is not connecting

To connect to the drone, connect to its wi-fi and then run the program. If it doesn't connect instantly, there are some things you might watch out for:

 - **(1) The Firewall**: Some specific ports must be open so that the drone can respond back. Port 8889 goes to the drone and is usually not a problem (outgoing). Ports 8890, 11111 and 36085 are ingoing and must be allowed.

 - **(2) Inside a Virtual Machine**: The same as above applies for a virtual machine. The ingoing ports must be allowed on both machines. Additionally, you must set up port forwarding for these 3 ports from your host to your VM. This is usually done in your VM's Hypervisor settings.

This library is released under the MIT License. This means you are allowed and even encouraged to copy and paste `tello.hpp` directly into your project. No installation or build process is necessary.

## AcknowledgementsðŸ’¡

This library uses the [UDPsocket](https://github.com/barczynsky/UDPsocket) single-header library, embedded directly into `tello.hpp` itself.
